          <h4>"Well I really don't know where to start. The first time I saw Dr. Henry, was about 6 months ago for sciatica on my right side. From my lower back, down my right leg would go completely numb. I couldn't walk straight, sleep through the night, or even sit straight. I was very sceptical, but shame on me. After the very first visit it was damn near gone, like nothing was wrong. I walked straight, slept through the night, and felt normal🤘🤘🤘. The second time was for something a little more serious. I race Mx, and broke my tibia and tibia in my right leg. It was break the Drs had never seen. It was called a spiral fracture. Long story short, I now have a plate and 22 screws. Here's the messed up part, I had never taken a pain pill in my life. Even with the broken bones, concussions, bumps, bruises, I've always took Aleve and stuff. This was a situation where that didn't help. In comes pain med. Hydrocodone turned into oxycotin, valium, and morphine. Needless to say, it made me mean, sleepy ,angry, always on edge. Spending 1,000 a month on the Dr and medication. Money i could have spent in way better shit. I realized what it was doing to me, my wife, and our 4 daughter's. So I was like that's it, enough is enough . I quit cold turkey,stop taking any kind of prescription meds, and drinking caffine. Only thing, I was still very sore, in pain, couldn't sleep, and for some reason very depressed and always tired. From all the research,that's part of detoxing. My wife new I was doing everything I could, to not take anything, but the pain was crazy bad. So she's like what about Dr. Henry, accupunture, I'm like shit it can't hurt. So I went to Dr. Henry. Told him what was going on, came up with a treatment plan. Funny thing is, I was the first patient he treated for addiction.😂😂😂. Well, i would have never known if he didnt tell me, because it worked. He is absolutely amazing, for never treating a patient for addiction, he did one hell of a job. He went to a seminar in Cali I believe, and when he came back, my appt was the next day. He used the new treatment he learned while at the class on me. I was the very first patient he used the new procedure on. Something to do with the head, anyways it worked. Fast forward a 8 visits and 2 months later. I've never been mor de healthy, happy, pain free, I don't even think about taking a thing. Goodys Back and body every now and then, or an aleve. Everyone sees a difference I my attitude, my demeanor , and just being back to the happy, smiling, and joker I was before. Best of all, my wife has her husband back and my daughter's have there daddy back. Not to I feel 100% on my Mx bike when I'm racing. Clear mind,focused, and back to just having fun on my bike,Not so serious. I still go twice a week, every week. Just to stay relaxed.So Dr. Henry and the staff at Lotus Accupunture, thanx for everything and all the help. You guys are absolutely amazing. You gave my wife her husband back, and my angels there daddy back. To us you guys will always be FAMILY. God Bless!!!!! Lotus Accupunture , go check Dr. Henry out. You won't regret it, I promise." 🤘🤘🤘💣💣💣👊👊👊🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆😁😁😁😁<br><br><span style="font-style:normal;">- Dale Bourg</span></h4>

          <h4>"I would give Dr. Vu 10 stars if that were an option! I've suffered for 6 years from an auto accident. I've had back surgery, neck surgery, about a dozen steroid injections, 48 sessions of physical rehabilitation, and a nerve block. My lower back gets so bad that I sometimes get stuck in bed for days and have to miss work. I walked, well I should say "I limped", into the office today and could not even sit down without leaning to one side. I know pain. The kind of pain I've been in takes away all normalcy. It takes away your existence as the person you once were. After one visit, yes I said one, I was able to stand up straight and walk without limping! I was able to sit down and get up....ON MY OWN! If anyone out there suffers from pain, please don't hesitate. Dr. Vo wants to help people, and he can absolutely help you get back to living. I look forward to my next visits because I know each visit will bring me closer to a full healing. I can't express how I felt when he looked at me and understood exactly what I was going through. He validated what I had been experiencing without pushing bills and injections that traditional medicine would have me do. He understood. And that right there, gives me hope. When you find someone who can actually make you feel better after just one visit, it brings your hope to a whole different level and it's coming from a much higher place. Thank you is not enough. Dr. Vo and his staff are the best! Even the receptionist was excited for me!! Don't hesitate. Acupuncture WORKS!"<br><br><span style="font-style:normal;">- Kathleen Fradella</span></h4>

            <h4>"I am a visitor from Las Vegas. I came to New Orleans to visit my mother-in-law due to her sickness right after my vacation of Alaska. Due to the weather and bed changed, my neck was stiff at 2nd day. I enjoyed the whole trip but my neck problem was getting serious, the pain went up to skull and came down to the shoulder. My husband had to help me to get up off the bed and put me down as well. So when I arrived New Orleans, I decided to find a acupuncture doctor to fix my problem. I had 2 acupuncture doctors in Las Vegas and I knew it helped me a lot, but Doctor Vu, Henry, he gave me the best experience and treatment that I had ever had before. After 2 treatments, my neck pain gone within one week. I come back to Las Vegas now and I believe I will miss Doctor Vu, how good his treatment is!!<br>

            By the way, his treatment is different, he put the needles on my legs at first 20 minutes, and he use acupressure to adjust my neck muscle, and he put 3 needles on top of my head. He was using moving cups and stable cups to improve blood circulation and put the needles on my neck at the final stage with electric facility. He took his time to fix my problems, no rush like other doctor. I really enjoyed the treatment and I highly recommend if you see this review, give him and yourself a chance, experience by your own, and then you will know what I talking about!!"<br><br><span style="font-style:normal;">- Jenny Baham</span></h4>

Trying to put off disc replacement surgery as long as possible.  I tried acupuncture at Lotus. I admit that I was very skeptical at first.  The treatments have brought some relief so far. I have been to Lotus 4 times and each time seems to help a little more. The facility is very clean and welcoming. I will continue with the treatments and hopefully I can put off the major surgery a little longer"<br><br><span style="font-style:normal;">

            <h4>"My issues with my back have been long standing and I've only been going to Lotus for a short time HOWEVER, in that time the progress has been a  steady progression.  I am enjoying things I had just not been able to do any longer because pain was so great.  I do still live in a good amount of pain but considering the gravity of the pain I came to Lotus with I can't expect miracles over night. I can honestly say things are "shifting" and I am noticing that the pain is much less in my lower back.  I'm regaining energy  that had been long gone (pain drains a LOT of energy for me as it takes so much to walk and bend etc and I work a full time job) but I am gardening in short term intervals which I hadn't done in such a long time and I am able to move up and down stairs holding things instead of holding the rails all along the way : )  ... I foresee and am hopeful that continuing to go for my sessions I will continue to see improvements.  Communication is very important so he knows what needs to be done.  I wish I could go more often but I'm only able to budget once a week and sometimes once every two weeks. BUT the point in mentioning this is because the progress is still there despite the delay in my treatments.  I will make additional updates as progress continues as I know anyone reading this will value those updates.  Much luck to everyone looking for relief; I'm sure you crossed a threshold at Lotus that will give you as well some relief and better tomorrow's ..."<br><br><span style="font-style:normal;">Judy Graham.</span></h4>

I am seeing him for a number of ailments that defy western medicine as i am considered a very healthy woman. I suffer mostly from fatigue, sleep issues, belly weight that got worse with birth control after pregnancy, to improve my immune system and bloating issues. I feel like my entire body had inflammation and it has been melting away with the belly wraps and feet soaks. The belly wrap seems to be helping my stomach get looser, so if you're anti needles you can pick some up and try. The feet soaks seem to help my achy feet from running and with sleep, as well. I see him for acupuncture and I felt good enough to go work out again and work on my house after one treatment. Can't recommend enough!
