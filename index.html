My strength in my arm, &amp; foot have improved!!! I am raising my leg &amp; arm higher!!! This has been a very good experience for me!!! My name is Tim Baham! I had a stroke in the month of September on the 15 of 2015. The stroke effected my right side. My right hand, my right arm, the right side of my mouth &amp; my right leg &amp; foot!!! I am also going to rehab at the Veterans Hospital! When I first had the stroke I went to West Jefferson Hospital where I received personal rehabilitation &amp; then I went to Wallenberg Home on Berhman Hwy from 19 Sep. 15 to Jan. 7, 2016 where I received great care. Then I went to Chicago Rehab Institute from 8 Aug. till 7 Sep. 16 after this I went to another place associated with it until Nov. 9th 16.

            <h4>"I am a visitor from Las Vegas. I came to New Orleans to visit my mother-in-law due to her sickness right after my vacation of Alaska. Due to the weather and bed changed, my neck was stiff at 2nd day. I enjoyed the whole trip but my neck problem was getting serious, the pain went up to skull and came down to the shoulder. My husband had to help me to get up off the bed and put me down as well. So when I arrived New Orleans, I decided to find a acupuncture doctor to fix my problem. I had 2 acupuncture doctors in Las Vegas and I knew it helped me a lot, but Doctor Vu, Henry, he gave me the best experience and treatment that I had ever had before. After 2 treatments, my neck pain gone within one week. I come back to Las Vegas now and I believe I will miss Doctor Vu, how good his treatment is!!<br>

        By the way, his treatment is different, he put the needles on my legs at first 20 minutes, and he use acupressure to adjust my neck muscle, and he put 3 needles on top of my head. He was using moving cups and stable cups to improve blood circulation and put the needles on my neck at the final stage with electric facility. He took his time to fix my problems, no rush like other doctor. I really enjoyed the treatment and I highly recommend if you see this review, give him and yourself a chance, experience by your own, and then you will know what I talking about!!

Trying to put off disc replacement surgery as long as possible.  I tried acupuncture at Lotus. I admit that I was very skeptical at first.  The treatments have brought some relief so far. I have been to Lotus 4 times and each time seems to help a little more. The facility is very clean and welcoming. I will continue with the treatments and hopefully I can put off the major surgery a little longer"<br><br><span style="font-style:normal;">
