       <h2 class="text-center slideanim">Acupuncture for Weight Loss</h2>
        <h3  class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 text-center">Non-invasive, natural weight loss therapy<br></h3>
        <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 ">
            <p>Over a quarter of the U.S. population are obese and well over 50% of diet products don’t work.<br>
            So, what about Acupuncture Weight Loss? <br>
            Within the practice of TCM, it is believed that excessive weight gains are mainly contributed by an imbalance of the organ systems of the body.  Therefore, the attention is focus on the specific areas to affect weight loss such as endocrine system and kidneys to treat water retention and to stimulate nerve and hormonal rebalance.  The spleen and thyroid glands to affect sugar and hormonal rebalancing, also the adrenal and the ovary glands are included to treat weight gain due to menopause and premenstrual syndrome(PMS).  Needles inserted into strategic trigger points in the body can help increase metabolism, suppress appetite and burn fat.  Acupuncture needles stimulate the nerves under the skin which signals the brain and nervous system affecting appetite.  The individual would then eat less and lose weight.<br></p>
        </div>
        <h3  class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 text-center">How does it work?</h3>
        <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 ">
            <p>Acupuncture can be effective in promoting weight loss through the insertion of needles.  When needles are inserted to specific energy pathways(body points) which can stimulate the releasing of endorphins, the body’s natural “feel good” hormones.  This can create calming, relaxing effect which can countermand the need to binge-eat that is brought on by increased frustration, stress and anxiety.  In this respect, acupuncture can bring calmness to those who are very afflicted and help them lose weight without resorting to synthetic drugs which can have host of negative side-effects.</p>
        </div>
            <h3 class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 text-center">How does auricular(ear) acupuncture aids weight loss?</h3>
        <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 ">
            <p>The outer ear has a connection to the entire body. The stimulation of different points of the ear with acupuncture needles affects certain areas of the body. The Hunger point, which is one of the five points, is linked to hunger and appetite is being targeted. Other points are also being utilized. Continuous stimulation can be used with NADA. Combining auricular acupuncture with standard acupuncture can improve the weight loss process<br></p>
        </div>
        
            <h3 class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 text-center">How soon can I see results?</h3>
        <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 ">
            <p>The effect and length of treatment varies with individual depending on the level of the negative effect on the organs system of the body, lifestyle, diet, and imbalances.  Some people notice the effects of acupuncture quickly after 2-3 sessions, some may take longer.  Incorporate with conventional methods such as mild exercise like walking, swimming at least 20 minutes a day along with a low-calorie diet can enhance the process.</p>

            <h4>"I am a visitor from Las Vegas. I came to New Orleans to visit my mother-in-law due to her sickness right after my vacation of Alaska. Due to the weather and bed changed, my neck was stiff at 2nd day. I enjoyed the whole trip but my neck problem was getting serious, the pain went up to skull and came down to the shoulder. My husband had to help me to get up off the bed and put me down as well. So when I arrived New Orleans, I decided to find a acupuncture doctor to fix my problem. I had 2 acupuncture doctors in Las Vegas and I knew it helped me a lot, but Doctor Vu, Henry, he gave me the best experience and treatment that I had ever had before. After 2 treatments, my neck pain gone within one week. I come back to Las Vegas now and I believe I will miss Doctor Vu, how good his treatment is!!<br>

        By the way, his treatment is different, he put the needles on my legs at first 20 minutes, and he use acupressure to adjust my neck muscle, and he put 3 needles on top of my head. He was using moving cups and stable cups to improve blood circulation and put the needles on my neck at the final stage with electric facility. He took his time to fix my problems, no rush like other doctor. I really enjoyed the treatment and I highly recommend if you see this review, give him and yourself a chance, experience by your own, and then you will know what I talking about!!

I have been to Lotus 4 times and each time seems to help a little more. The facility is very clean and welcoming.
